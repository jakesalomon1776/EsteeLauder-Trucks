# EsteeLauder-Trucks
The .zip file is a directory/project for a nicer-looking web page created with OpenElement.
If you unzip it you will find a FoodTrucks folder and within that, two .html files.

The main one to run is, of course, "FoodTrucks.htm".  The elements needed are aminly the
picture of the food truck.  All the other files & folders are artifcts of OpenElement,
which obviously expects bigger things of me. ;-)
